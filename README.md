# MyReads Project

My Reads is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.
The goal of the project is to create an application to track all your books, classifying them in "Currently Reading", "Want to Read" or "Read" status.

## Code Dependencies
- Udacity's base project[https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter]
- `react` library and all the packages that are loaded when installing the facebook's `create-react-app`
- `react-router`
- `react-debounce-input`

## Instructions
To run the project locally, do the following:
- run `git clone https://github.com/cenoura/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git` to clone the current repository 
- run `cd reactnd-project-myreads-starter` to enter the project's directory;
- run `npm install` to install all project dependencies
- run `npm start` to start the application server

## How to use
The app shows three shelves: "Want to Read", "Currently Reading" and "Read".
To add books to shelves, you need to use the search function. After the book you want to add to a shelf is presented, use the dropdown menu to put it on the shelf.
To manage books that already are on your shelves, you must use the dropdown also.

## Compatibility
This application was developed using Google Chrome v67.
